# DISCO
**Distributed Show Control**  

DISCO is a next generation live performance framework to interconnect and control software systems. DISCO is designed to meet the rapidly evolving needs of live media productions with a focus on realtime content creation. With its roots as a vj-software it is designed to provide the most versatile way to control and operate even complex techincal setups.

Beside classical media-servers which mostly provide prerendered content, realtime authoring environments like touch-designer or d3, game-engines like unity or unreal or even plain programming languages like vvvv or open-frameworks are used quite frequently in live productions to create content in realtime. On top of that also the IoT is hitting the live production business. Nowadays we will find a range of different devices like tracking devices, beacons or even wearables on site. It is then not uncommon that during a production one will find a a Heterogeneous mixture of different content creation systems which are interconnected in a network.
