# Disco documentation Generator

Fable Node.js app to generate Disco documentation as static web pages.

## Installing dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

## Developing

To start Fable in watch mode and launch a local server so you can see results in real time, run:

```shell
npm run start
```

> The first compilation will take some seconds so you will have to refresh the browser after that.

To just generate the `.html` pages once, run:

```shell
npm run build
```
